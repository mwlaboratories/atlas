* Atlas
34-key split keyboard with TrackPoint, using XIAO BLE controllers and a dongle.

** Status (Dec 2025)
- Left side TrackPoint working (Sprintek all-in-one module)
- Mouse layer auto-activates on trackpoint movement
- Press-to-select (tap trackpoint = left click) working
- Still experiencing random crashes - likely noisy UART lines (hardware issue)

** Hardware Notes
- Reset pin required for reliable trackpoint init
- Crashes may need shorter wires or external pull-up resistors on CLK/DATA lines

** Build
#+begin_src bash
nix develop
just build all
#+end_src

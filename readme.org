* Atlas
34-key split keyboard with TrackPoint and Trackball, using XIAO BLE controllers and a dongle.

** Status (Dec 2025)
- Left side TrackPoint working (Sprintek all-in-one module)
- Standalone PMW3610 trackball working as third peripheral
- Mouse layer auto-activates on trackpoint/trackball movement
- Snipe mode (slow cursor) and scroll mode working
- Press-to-select (tap trackpoint = left click) working

** Architecture
#+begin_example
Dongle (central) <-- Left (trackpoint) + Right (keyboard) + Trackball (PMW3610)
#+end_example

** Mouse Layer
When moving trackpoint or trackball, layer 5 auto-activates for 3 seconds.

Thumb keys become:
| SNIPE | SCROLL | LEFT CLICK | RIGHT CLICK |

- *Snipe*: Hold for 1/4 cursor speed (precision mode)
- *Scroll*: Hold to convert movement to scroll wheel

** Hardware Notes
- TrackPoint: Random crashes may need shorter wires or external pull-up resistors on CLK/DATA
- Trackball: Uses 3-wire SPI (MOSI/MISO shared on D9)

** Build
#+begin_src bash
nix develop
just build all
#+end_src

** Flashing After Config Changes
If peripheral count changes, must re-pair all devices:
1. Flash =settings_reset= to all devices
2. Flash new firmware to all
3. Power on dongle first, then peripherals

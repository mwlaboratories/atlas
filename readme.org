* Atlas
Atlas is a split keyboard with:
- 34 keys
- Dual TrackPoints (one per half)
- Optional oversized standalone trackball

*** WARNING: 
Work in progress, still untested, PCB's might not work if you order them as is.

A dongle will likely be required to get zmk to play nice with dual TrackPoints.
Any movement on a pointing device should automatically trigger the mousekey layer.
Battery is currently a 401025 sized lipo, but I'd like to go a bit bigger.

Trackball uses a 57.2mm sized pool ball, has space for a 501522 lipo, the PCB is a modded AdeptBLE PCB.

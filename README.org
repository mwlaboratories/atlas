* Atlas
Atlas is a split keyboard with:
- 34 keys
- Dual TrackPoints (one per half)
- Optional oversized standalone trackball

I think a dongle will be needed for the dual TrackPoints to work.  

When moving any pointing device, the *mousekey layer* activates automatically.  
This makes cool setups possible, e.g.:
- Left TrackPoint = high sensitivity
- Right TrackPoint = low sensitivity
- Trackball = fast scrolling / navigation

* Progress
